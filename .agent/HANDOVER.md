# AI Agent Handover: Portfolio Professional Boost

## Context
This project involved upgrading a Jekyll-based GitHub portfolio for a Senior Software Architect (30+ years experience). The primary goal was to shift the positioning from a general monolith developer (Django/REST) to a modern enterprise architect (FastAPI/Next.js/Microservices).

## Current Status
- [x] Content optimization across all 5 pages.
- [x] Professional tone and positioning redefined.
- [x] UI/UX enhancements (noise texture, magnetic buttons, custom scrollbars, reveal effects).
- [x] Specific focus on **React Query (TanStack)** for UX/Performance.
- [x] Refactored styling to a consistent **Utility-First (Tailwind-consistent)** architecture.
- [x] Verification completed for content and visual integrity.

## Next Steps for Future Agents
- User will handle Git commit and push manually after review.
- Any further refinements should maintain the "Senior Architect" premium aesthetic.
- Ensure any new backend logic continues to prioritize FastAPI/Python over legacy frameworks where appropriate.
